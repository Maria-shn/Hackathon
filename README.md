# Feel NICE

This is a project for the RU hackathon, aimed at implementing an algorithm which will analyze a customer's emotion while texting with a customer service representative or with a BOT. The algorithm is designed to signal the escalations of emotions at the end of the conversation, through a report. This is a tool for improvement for the automatic service representative (BOT) but also for human representatives who talk with customers through text.

## Target Audience and Use Cases

The target audience for this are NICE customers who require assistance with their customer assistance for products or services, especially those that have a target audience of young adults aged 18-30. The algorithm will analyze text messages from issues such as:

- Product support
- Billing inquiries
- Technical issues


## Technology

In the demo phase we analyze fictional chat messages, using an imported library that assigns values to phrases and emojis. We use an NLP-based AI to compare the responses that generated a negative emotion in the customer in order to find patterns  to make a report with detailed analytics on how the human or bot could improve based on the texts of the customer.

## Testing and Refinement

We hope to thoroughly test the algorithm to ensure accurate interpretation of customer-agent conversations. Feedback will be collected from users to refine and improve the algorithm's performance.

## Integration with Other NICE Services

As an additional challenge, the algorithm can be integrated with other NICE services and products, as NICE offers a platform to improve the customer service representatives when when talking to customers, our program could help NICE's clients' bots and customer service representatives that work based on text.
