# NICE AI

This is a project for the RU hackathon, aimed at implementing an AI to improve customer service and support. The AI is designed to understand, process and respond to customer inquiries in a natural, conversational way, using natural language processing (NLP) technology. The AI will create a detailed report based on a written conversation between a client and an agent and will send it to a database if no similar reports already exist. Thus the new data developed by the AI can be used by implemented chatbots for similar customer enquiries in the future. 

## Target Audience and Use Cases

The target audience for the are NICE customers who require assistance with their products or services. The AI will be used to address specific use cases, such as:

- Product support
- Billing inquiries
- Technical issues
- Data

The AI has access to a large dataset of customer messages and responses, gathered from various sources, such as customer emails, social media messages, and chat logs. The data has been preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information.

## Technology
(TO BE EDITED!!!)
The chatbot has been built using Python and the TensorFlow framework for NLP. The model has been trained using machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to ensure accurate interpretation and response to customer inquiries.

## Testing and Refinement

We hope to thoroughly test the AI to ensure accurate interpretation of customer-agent conversations. Feedback will be collected from users to refine and improve the AI's performance.

## Integration with Other NICE Services

As an additional challenge, the AI can bee integrated with other NICE services and products, such as voice recognition, video support, and AI for personalization. This will result in a more comprehensive and effective customer service solution.
